      <description>Over the past week I participated in Hong Leong Bank&amp;rsquo;s(HLB) annual Can You Hack It 2020 Datathon, and managed a top 10 finish after pitching to a (digital) panel of C-suite and M.D. level judges. The experience was certainly eye-opening and very hard-earned, with my nearly throwing in the towel at multiple points throughout the event.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to share a little on the event itself, the problem and my motivation towards the solution, and the lessons I&amp;rsquo;d be bringing into my next hackathon, which I hope would be useful to you, dear reader.</description>

      <description>From 2016-2019 I had the privilege of rolling with a start-up through its explosive growth, stagnation, and subsequent demise all in the period of 3 odd years. These are some of the hard-earned lessons gained through my time in the trenches, all of which point to my core thesis that the end-to-end food delivery business model is not viable. This post will be structured as follows:
 Breaking down the lay of the land in 2015 The (apparent) strengths of the business model Why it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, and the lessons thereof  In the beginning (circa 2015) By now, startup purgatory is filled with the corpses of well-funded attempts such as Munchery, Sprig, Maple, Spoonrocket and our own.</description>
