<title>Food Delivery Doesn&#39;t Work | The ArnieBarnie</title>
<meta name="description" content="From 2016-2019 I had the privilege of rolling with a start-up through its explosive growth, stagnation, and subsequent demise all in the period of 3 odd years. These are some of the hard-earned lessons gained through my time in the trenches, all of which point to my core thesis that the end-to-end food delivery business model is not viable. This post will be structured as follows:
 Breaking down the lay of the land in 2015 The (apparent) strengths of the business model Why it doesn&rsquo;t work, and the lessons thereof  In the beginning (circa 2015) By now, startup purgatory is filled with the corpses of well-funded attempts such as Munchery, Sprig, Maple, Spoonrocket and our own.">

        <p>From 2016-2019 I had the privilege of rolling with a start-up through its explosive growth, stagnation, and subsequent demise all in the period of 3 odd years. These are some of the hard-earned lessons gained through my time in the trenches, all of which point to my core thesis that the <em>end-to-end food delivery business model</em> is <strong>not viable</strong>. This post will be structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking down the lay of the land in 2015</li>
<li>The (apparent) strengths of the business model</li>
<li>Why it doesn&rsquo;t work, and the lessons thereof</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-the-beginning-circa-2015">In the beginning (circa 2015)</h2>
<p>By now, startup purgatory is filled with the corpses of well-funded attempts such as Munchery, Sprig, Maple, Spoonrocket and our own. But hindsight is 20-20 as they say, and in the heydays circa 2015 prior to the spectacular demise of WeWork, things were actually looking rather rosy. The industry was on the tail-end of <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/food-delivery-startups-funding-exits/">optimistic investor sentiment</a>, with American startups like Munchery, Maple and Sprig commanding hundreds of millions in VC funding and were pursuing aggressive multi-city expansion plans.</p>
<p>In an ironic foreshadowing of short-lived investor optimism, a Sherpa Ventures VC extolled the <a href="https://medium.com/@shervin/how-munchery-is-literally-eating-the-world-218c6520dc99">game-changing virtues of Munchery</a> which was then valued at USD 300M: reduced CAPEX, improved margins, and heightened competitive barriers. We will revisit them at the end of this post.</p>

<p>Bringing it back to Malaysia, now-established heavyweights such as UberEats (est. Sept 2017, RIP May 2018), Grabfood (est. May 2018) were non-existent. The <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/the-changing-market-for-food-delivery">dominant aggregator-model</a> player at the time, Foodpanda weren&rsquo;t <a href="http://www.rojakdaily.com/lifestyle/article/3846/we-try-to-find-out-why-the-food-delivery-service-in-malaysia-is-so-horrible">doing so hot.</a> The rest of the landscape is occupied by smaller, localized players with none approaching the scale of Grabfood or Ubereats, with (maybe) dahmakan having the biggest slice of the admittedly very small pie. A brief timeline of a select few of these short-lived startups is per below:</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="the-business-model">The business model</h2>
<p>The business model was simple: a <strong>full-stack</strong>, <strong>vertically integrated</strong>, end-to-end meal delivery provider (buzzwords galore!) that handled both the <em>preparation</em> and <em>delivery</em> of the food. Operations would be split between an in-house kitchen production facility and logistics, which handled the routing and delivery of the product, which was primarily <strong>lunchbox-style food boxes</strong>. Everything would be conducted purely online using either proprietary ordering web or app-based mechanisms or 3rd party SaaS&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>This is markedly different from the  aggregator-type model used by Foodpanda, which functions by hosting a large number of partners on their  platform, provide logistical (ordering &amp; delivery) services and then charge them a percentage of their total cart value, typically about <strong>30%</strong>, which is a rate that is often considered to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/31/dining/los-angeles-food-delivery-runningman.html?searchResultPosition=2">flat-out predatory</a> by partnering restaurant
.</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, aggregator-types are limited to entities that have secured  significantly larger sources of funding, have a tunnel-visioned like focus on <strong>growth</strong>, and can only work at scale. Fullstack operators tend to be smaller with much more limited geographical operations, have much lower valuations than their aggregator counterparts, and have significantly <strong>shorter</strong> lifespans.</p>
<p><img src="https://aforlorncat1.github.io/images/cooked/aggvsfull.png" width="100%"><center><i>A lot of these are dead, and (almost) none are making money.</i></center></p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t realise this at the time. The untested, glittering environment proved to be very attractive, and so did the perceived advantages of the fullstack approach. Let&rsquo;s visit each of them in turn:</p>
<h3 id="managing-our-own-deliveryfleet---">Managing our own delivery fleet  🏍 🚗 🚚</h3>
<p>&hellip;meant quicker delivery times, higher quality of service, and increased flexibility of operational responsibilities. Riders could double up as catering assemblers, lunchbox packers, even last-minute procurement picker-uppers. 3PLs (Third party logistics) could not provide such flexibility. As the delivery riders were often the only point of contact between the business and the customer, having our own delivery fleet allowed for a more rigorous recruitment process and higher training standards.</p>
<h3 id="extremely-capable-kitchenstaff---">Extremely capable kitchen staff 🍔 🍛 🍱</h3>
<p>Mainly sourced from 5-star hotel backgrounds, high-caliber chefs could combine their vast experience with multiple cuisine types and extensive R&amp;D work into food readiness for delivery, thus creating a winning combination that could also function as a value-add feature in our marketing.</p>
<h3 id="no-storefront-required---">No Storefront required 🏢 🏨 🏩</h3>
<p>With all revenue coming from online sources, there would be no need for a high-rent location with heavy footfall, nor for expensive facades for walk-in customers. The location that we chose was very close to the KL city centre and was close enough to major highways to allow for high levels of connectivity at a very reasonal dollar per square foot.</p>
<h4 id="sounds-good-right">Sounds good, right?</h4>
<p>Despite how great these advantages appeared to be, the fact that we only survived for a scant 3 years and never saw a dollar of profit begs to differ. This brings us now to the crux of my post: <strong>why doesn&rsquo;t the full-stack food delivery model work?</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="lesson-1-the-real-cost-of-delivery">Lesson 1: The Real Cost of Delivery</h2>
<p>Let me be real straight up, we <strong>never got the delivery part to work</strong>. Threading the line between high availability and timely delivery proved to be too hard to balance. For example, we offered a 3 hour window for customers to order during lunchtime, with timeslots available on every half-hour. Note that this is not considered <strong>on-demand</strong>: customers had the ability to order beforehand and up till 10:30am on the same day. We very quickly realised that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost all customers opted for the first available timeslot, even after incentives for later slots were offered.</li>
<li>Failed or delayed deliveries caused a domino effect that affected the rest of the delivery chain.</li>
<li>Inclement weather, condos with tight security, offices with poor accessibility or motorcycle parking all caused huge delays and could not be predicted easily.</li>
<li>Rider utilization never hit full efficiency; there would always be riders that only had 1 delivery to a far-off location per day.</li>
</ul>
<p>The delivery process was inherently inefficient, even with bleeding edge routing algorithms and tracking software. There would always be either too <em>many</em> or too <em>few</em> riders for each day&rsquo;s demand, causing either riders having nothing to do or massive delays.</p>
<p>Another delivery issue was with <strong>large quantity orders</strong>. For orders that could not fit in a single rider&rsquo;s carrying capacity, we had several options (none of them being very viable):</p>
<ol>
<li>Employ 3PL cars or vans, which were an order of magnitude more expensive.</li>
<li>Combine 2 or more delivery riders to take the order, which meant those riders only had 1 delivery to make for the day.</li>
<li>Use our own staff vehicles to deliver; even more expensive and not scaleable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that demand for both the individual order and bulk quantities are seasonal in nature, we could not lock down discounted rates with 3PLs by assuring them a high volume of usage. Combined with the fact that 84% of shoppers are unlikely to buy from a company again after a <a href="https://optimoroute.com/last-mile-delivery/">bad last mile delivery experience,</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/us/amazon-delivery-drivers-accidents.html">high accident rates of delivery riders</a>, last mile delivery is a <em>very, very</em> costly affair.</p>
<h2 id="lesson-2-the-menu-is-never-enough">Lesson 2: The Menu is Never Enough</h2>
<p>We built up a recipe bank of several hundred combinations of starches, proteins and veggies and experimented with both the number of products offered daily and the product rotation system. No matter what we tried, customers would complain that we <em>did not have enough variety</em> and that everything seemed similar everytime they visited.</p>
<p>This proved to be especially problematic with <strong>corporate customers</strong> that we tried to lock in for recurring weekly orders. They would quickly tire of our offerings and moved beyond us altogether once Grabfood picked up steam. This is exceptionally painful since these highly profitable customers were often a product of genuine human connection, relationships that were carefully cultivated and nurtured after a long period of time. We simply could not offer the same variety that an aggregator could provide, e.g. <em>a dozen dishes</em> versus <em>a few hundred</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://aforlorncat1.github.io/images/cooked/grab_opt.gif" width="100%"><center><i>How on earth are we supposed to fight that?</i></center></p>
<p>The items that we could offer were limited by their ability to <strong>sustain delivery</strong>. Mashed potatoes paired with a rich brown sauce was one key dish heavily favoured by customers, but was highly prone to degradation during delivery. <strong>Pasta dishes</strong> were notoriously difficult to time correctly; we received complaints about both over-cooked and underdone pastas in equal quantities. <strong>Deep fried</strong> foods are a lost cause altogether.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://aforlorncat1.github.io/images/cooked/mashed.jpg" height="100%"></center><center><i>Doesn't look nearly as good after 2 hours.</i></center></p>
<p>Dominoes is somewhat of an exception to this rule. Dominoes&rsquo; signature pizzas rate highly as a delivered food item even though the taste of pizza drops off tremendously with time, but still commands tremendous demand due to their extremely high convenience value (ease of ordering, no need to dispose of any cutlery, world-class delivery).</p>
<h4 id="the-best-intentions-dont-necessarily-scale-well">The Best Intentions Don’t Necessarily Scale well</h4>
<br>
<p>Initially, the chefs had R&amp;D sessions every Saturday where great care was taken to identify favourable cuisines, select popular and familiar items from each segment, iterate with ingredients and cooking methods and test it for production scalability and delivery hardiness. A <strong>“wow”</strong> component was greatly emphasised in each dish.</p>
<p>For example, our initial menu had very ornate, high-cost starch recipes that incorporated a mixture of herbs, ghee, and lentils. Feedback indicated that this approach did not pay off; customers only noticed the quality of the starch in passing. Did not justify the high costs.</p>
<p>By the time the 4th month rolled around and the hyper growth phase hit, the R&amp;D effort was (more-or-less) permanently abandoned, much to our long-term detriment. Once halted, it never returned, and all subsequent new dishes never had the same impact as the initial bank of food.</p>
<h2 id="lesson-3-mistaking-novelty-for-demand">Lesson 3: Mistaking Novelty for Demand</h2>
<p>In the time before the age of food delivery normalcy, Malaysian millenials would tell you that the only options available for takeout were McDelivery, Pizza Hut/Dominoes and the Tiffin carrier.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://aforlorncat1.github.io/images/cooked/tiffin.jpeg"></center><center><i>Pioneering delivery since the 18th century.</i></center></p>
<p>The growth years for us occurred in 2016-2017 and were hallmarked by several key events: the immaturity of competition in the same space and the non-existence of <strong>Grabfood</strong>. We won over corporate customers with our sleek online veneer from aging catering companies which never bothered to cobble together any meaningful online presense. The average customer on the street had never before had the ability to order non-fast food style meals from their phone or computer so easily before. For a brief, glorious moment in time, we were <strong>new, exciting</strong> and <strong>sexy</strong>.</p>
<p>However, these positive elements are fleeting and the low barriers to entry for food delivery meant many folks caught on quickly. As the industry matured and more logistic providers appeared on the scene, the novelty factor became quickly irrelevent. The same applied to the big players as well: Uber was forced to sell money-losing <a href="%5Bhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/technology/india-restaurants-logout-delivery-zomato.html%5D(https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/technology/india-restaurants-logout-delivery-zomato.html)">Uber Eats to Zomato in India</a>, but not before spending heavily on subsidies and promotional offers to gain new users. Honestbee relied on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/25/time-maybee-running-out-for-honestbee/">outrageous promotions and never got their model to work in any of their markets</a>. Even existing heavyweights Grabfood and Foodpanda consistently throw out promotional codes and rely heavily on their loyalty point ecosystem to edge out each other.</p>

<!-- Bear in mind that the business-customer relationship is **non-contractual**. Customers are free to buy or not at any given time. Our best customers make large orders for events that are not regular or time-bound and cannot be relied on for consistent revenue. -->

<h2 id="lesson-4-the-economics-dont-scale">Lesson 4: The Economics Don&rsquo;t Scale</h2>
<p>Purely digital businesses that are not super-apps suffer from poor Top Of Mind Awareness and thus have notoriously high levels of customer churn. Even more so for F&amp;B businesses whose products are elastic and easily substituted. How then does a digital food delivery business create continuous demand for their product in order to ensure their riders (who are already paid for) will have customers to deliver to?</p>
<p>Discounts. Lots of discounts.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://aforlorncat1.github.io/images/cooked/ideal_econs.png" width="50%"></center><center><i>The fairytale chart in every pitch deck.</i></center></p>
<p>This is the sort of unit economics breakdown you can expect in an ideal world where politics is driven by altruism and people exercise 3 times a week for 30 minutes. Everything is neat, tidy, and isolated from reality. Customers magically find the products without any form of advertising or incentives and the kitchen produces absolutely zero waste.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://aforlorncat1.github.io/images/cooked/real_econs.png" width="50%"></center><center><i>The version that VCs will never see.</i></center></p>
<p>This is the sort of chart that realistically reflects our operating margins for the majority of the time we were in business. The COGS category is split into more reflective sub-categories of <em>food costs</em>, <em>packaging</em> and <em>food waste.</em> The golden standard for food costs in terms of ingredients (as per our ex-Sheraton head chef) is <strong>30%</strong>. Not impossible, but very hard to maintain consistently without a watertight procurement and production monitoring system.</p>
<p><strong>Food waste</strong> is a particularly serious issue for food delivery businesses that do not run on an on-demand basis. Because our customers order their food hours or days beforehand, the production for each day rarely (if ever) mirrors the actual demand for the day. Overproducing meant high wastage, underproducing meant not satisfying existing demand and creates a lower revenue number that potential investors don&rsquo;t  really fancy. Not to mention the actual wastage produced for every lunchbox produced.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://aforlorncat1.github.io/images/cooked/real_econs.png" width="50%"></center><center><i>The version that VCs will never see.</i></center></p>
<p><strong>Customer acquisition and retention</strong> is another under-represented factor. Word-of-Mouth marketing is non-existent and unrealiable. First-time customers get lured in by attractive new user discounts and only get retained by further discounts. Operational hiccups like late deliveries, spillage en route, or the occasional food spoilage all require <em>mea culpa</em> discounts, and they all add up very quickly.</p>
<p>Unlike in VC pitches, these problems do not go away once we reach the nirvana of economics of scale. On the contrary, the delivery costs will only balloon up more and more as full rider utilization becomes increasingly trickier to achieve and larger orders require higher CAPEX for higher capacity vehicles. Employing a 3PL delivery fleet doesn&rsquo;t guarantee lower costs either.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Merely rebranding a low-margin business as e-commerce does not magically make the margins sustainable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Purely delivery-based models also lose out to brick &amp; mortar stores when it comes to high margin auxilliary products. Items such as drinks, shisha or liquor require significantly less effort and can be stored indefinitely, but cannot be delivered. Soft drinks on tap costs literally cents to produce per cup and gets sold for magnitudes more, but few customers would be willing to buy drinks via delivery unless they were forced into a bundle.</p>
<p>Ultimately, despite the advances in routing and transportation capabilities, the net gain from the operational efficiencies of squeezing 4 deliveries per hour instead of 3 will always be outpaced by the <strong>net loss from marketing/subsidy spend</strong> required to <em>spur on customer growth</em>. Even at scale, the economics don&rsquo;t work out. So why do it?</p>
<h2 id="i-rest-my-case">I Rest My Case</h2>
<p>Our outfit officially shut down in April 2019. We had sold hundreds of thousands of boxes, recorded millions of Ringgit in revenue, and even had half a million in financial backing from Cradle and it <em>still</em> wasn&rsquo;t enough to make the business model work. None of our American counterparts could get it to work either. Even in the height of the pandemic when demand for food delivery was at an all-time high, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/technology/india-restaurants-logout-delivery-zomato.html">DoorDash was still losing money.</a></p>
<p>Singapore&rsquo;s Grain took 5 years before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/09/grain-10-million-profitable-food-delivery/">claiming to be profitable</a>, which is not something <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/dahmakan-a-malaysian-full-stack-food-delivery-startup-raises-18-million-series-b/">$18M Series B dahmakan</a> can say for themselves. Other Malaysian attempts have either died or (wisely) chosen to not scale up, opting to be a <em>jaguh kampung</em> instead and take care of their respective neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Remember the optimistic VC man from earlier? The much hyped Munchery of America died and ignoble death in 2019 after raising USD 125M and achieving a valuation of USD 300M at its peak, and left many of its <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90315825/how-muncherys-high-hopes-led-to-its-decline-and-fall">suppliers, vendors and customers in the lurch with millions in unfulfilled gift cards and unpaid debts.</a>
I close with the wise words of Pascal Rigo, Munchery&rsquo;s (former) Chief Customer Experience Officer:</p>
<p><strong>You can either be a good food company or a good delivery company, but I don&rsquo;t think anyone has been able to do both.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Neither have I mate, neither have I.</p>
